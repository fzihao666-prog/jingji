# Governance

## CI gates — merge-blocking, in this order

1. Typecheck (`tsc --noEmit`) and lint (ESLint + Stylelint per `tooling`).
2. Unit + story tests (Vitest incl. Storybook Vitest addon), with a11y violations at serious/critical failing.
3. E2E on critical paths (Playwright) + axe scan spec.
4. Dependency audit — high + critical block.
5. Secrets scan (gitleaks or equivalent) — any finding blocks.
6. License check — denied license blocks (policy below).
7. Bundle-size budget check (`size-limit` or Lighthouse CI).
8. Security-review (Semgrep heuristics in `templates/.semgrep/` for webhook-missing-verification, SSRF, secret exposure, and unsanitized HTML; zod-at-boundary and IDOR have no reliable static rule and stay review-only).

Classify the deliverable first: production app, component/library package, static content site, prototype, or policy/docs repository. The gates above are mandatory for a production app; for other types, mark a gate NOT APPLICABLE only with a concrete reason (for example, no client bundle or no browser journey). A missing applicable gate is NOT CONFIGURED and blocks merging; it is not a pass. Temporary exceptions record reason, owner, expiry, and human approval. Starter configs implementing these gates (CI workflow, gitleaks, ESLint, Stylelint) live in `templates/` — copy and adapt them rather than authoring from scratch.

## Toolchain pinning

- Node: `engines` in package.json + `.nvmrc` (same version); CI uses the same pin.
- Package manager: `packageManager` field + corepack; enforce a single PM with `only-allow` in `preinstall`. Never mix lockfiles.

## Dependency lifecycle

- Updates via Renovate/Dependabot: grouped, with a minimum release age of 3 days (cooldown) so freshly-published compromised versions don't auto-merge. Break-glass: a fix for a known exploited/critical CVE may bypass the cooldown with a named approver's sign-off recorded on the PR.
- Emit an SBOM (CycloneDX) in CI for release builds.
- Pin GitHub Actions (and other CI plugins) by commit SHA; pin CI container images (e.g. the Semgrep job's `semgrep/semgrep`) by digest (`@sha256:…`), not a floating tag.
- Add-time vetting rules live in `frontend-security` (install scripts, typosquatting, registry pinning).

## License policy

- Allowed for shipped frontend code: MIT, Apache-2.0, BSD-2/3-Clause, ISC, 0BSD.
- A real framework tree (Astro/Vite) also legitimately carries permissive-but-unlisted licenses: CC0-1.0 and CC-BY-4.0 (data packages like `caniuse-lite`), Python-2.0 (`argparse`), BlueOak-1.0.0 (`lru-cache`, `sax`). These are non-copyleft — add them to the allowlist rather than failing the gate. Run `license-checker --summary` FIRST when the gate goes red: `--onlyAllow` stops at the first offender, so a bare allowlist turns license triage into whack-a-mole.
- Self-application: this rules repo itself is MIT-licensed (`LICENSE`) — the policy it demands of dependencies holds for its own artifact.
- Denied: GPL/LGPL/AGPL, SSPL, BUSL, unlicensed/unknown. Anything else: ask before adding.
  - Carve-out (named legal/human sign-off, per case): LGPL is acceptable ONLY for a prebuilt shared-library binary that is dynamically used and never enters the shipped bundle — e.g. `@img/sharp-libvips-*` pulled in by Astro's image tooling. Exclude it explicitly (`--exclude "LGPL-3.0-or-later"`) with an in-file comment naming the package and reason; LGPL in shipped, statically-linked code stays denied.
- Exclude your own private root package (`--excludePrivatePackages`) — it reports as UNLICENSED and is not a third-party dependency.
- Enforce in CI (`license-checker` / FOSSA / Snyk). Dev-only tooling may be reviewed case-by-case, but default to the same list.

## Secrets scanning

- gitleaks (or equivalent) in pre-commit AND CI; enable push protection on the hosting platform.
- A detected leak = rotate immediately, then purge; rotation is the fix, history rewriting is cleanup.

## Change control — the rules themselves

- The privileged instruction paths enumerated under "Sensitive paths" below can silently change every AI agent's behavior. Protect that complete set with CODEOWNERS requiring platform/security-team review, and require CODEOWNERS review in branch protection.
- Disclosure and incident response are defined in `SECURITY.md`; every release is recorded in `CHANGELOG.md`.
- This rules repo is versioned (git + CHANGELOG); projects consume a tagged version, not ad-hoc copies, so audits can tell which rules governed which commits.
- Security and a11y rules are EXEMPT from "prune rules that are being followed" maintenance — a control that is working is not redundant.

## Sensitive paths — human sign-off required

AI agents must not modify without explicit human approval: CI/release/deploy configuration; auth/session/payment modules; security headers/CSP; lockfiles; and privileged Codex instructions, profiles, generated plugin output, or build/install scripts (`AGENTS*.md`, `profiles/**`, `.agents/**`, `.codex/**`, `platforms/codex/**`, `plugins/codex-frontend-skills/**`, and their generators/installers). Propose the specific diff and wait before the write; approval cannot be backdated. Codex `PreToolUse` cannot pause for an approval prompt, so enforce this with pre-write sign-off plus CODEOWNERS/branch protection.

## Git & PR conventions

- Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`…); imperative subject ≤ 72 chars; body explains why.
- Branch naming: `feat/<slug>`, `fix/<slug>`, `chore/<slug>`.
- PRs: small and single-purpose; description includes what/why and test evidence (commands run + result); note AI assistance where the org requires disclosure. Squash-merge to keep main linear.

## Observability

- Production applications with user traffic or business-critical workflows need owned error monitoring: release tagging, source maps uploaded privately (never publicly served), PII scrubbing, sampling, and actionable alerts. A static demo, prototype, library, or policy/docs repository may omit runtime monitoring when the reason and owner are documented; do not add a monitoring dependency merely to satisfy this sentence.

## Performance budgets

- Core Web Vitals targets: LCP ≤ 2.5 s, INP ≤ 200 ms, CLS ≤ 0.1 (p75, field data).
- Client JS budget per route enforced in CI (`size-limit`); a sensible default initial-load ceiling is ~170 kB gzipped JS per route (tune per product/device profile). Adding a dependency that breaks the budget requires the `frontend-security`/governance dependency review, not a budget bump.

## Browser support

- Define a `browserslist` (default: Baseline Widely Available) — it drives transpilation/polyfills, which CSS features are usable without fallback, and the Playwright browser matrix. Don't leave support implicit.
